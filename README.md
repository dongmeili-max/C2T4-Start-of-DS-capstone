Target: Whether To Get COVID-19 Vaccine: https://www.pewresearch.org/science/dataset/american-trends-panel-wave-74/ (Sep 2020)

overall thoughts:
1 Definitely get the vaccine
2 Probably get the vaccine
3 Probably NOT get the vaccine
4 Definitely NOT get the vaccine   (classification problem)

Differences by features (demographics: gender, partry, region, education, etc.) and associations

Can Target be predicted based on demographics?
